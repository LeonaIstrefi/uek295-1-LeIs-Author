#### Step 1. 
<p> For Step 1, you need to download these things:</p>
<ul>
 <li> Docker </li>
  <li>Postman </li>
  <li>Java Development 17 (or 21)</li>
  <li>Gradle</li>
</ul>

#### Step 2. 
<p> Now you need to set up your DB with this code:</p>

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Step 3. 
<p> Now all you need to do is run Gradle. if you have been following my steps, you will have Gradle already downloaded. Now all you need to do is run it with this following command: 
  bash gradle bootrun. 
If you want to refresh bootrun, you have to klick on the refresh button.

</p>

#### Step 4. 
<p>Now you can start coding! After you have Implemented you Endpoints, you need to check if you can see them on this website: http://localhost:8080.</p>
<p> If you can see your Endpoints, you need to test them with Postman! Again, if you have followed all my steps, you have already downloaded Postman. (You do not need to Log in to use Postman!)</p>

#### Step 5. 
<p> If you have tested your Endpoints, and the work, then you can view your API Documentation on Swagger! This is the link: localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html </p>

#### Step 6. 
<p> After you have officially done everything, you now only need to close the docker:
